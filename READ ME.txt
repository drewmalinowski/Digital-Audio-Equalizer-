Anaconda Prompt:

pip install pandas
pip install mutagen

The text files containing signal data can be imported to and exported from/to
MP3 files using Audacity (Tools - Sample Data Export/Import)

However, the input file in the python program must be a .csv file, 
so export a .txt file from Audacity and save it as a .csv file in Excel. 

You may have to slightly change the format of the .csv file 
in order for the EQ program to properly read it. Make sure the cell in row 1 column 1
contains 'L' while the cell in row 1 column 2 contains 'R'. Below should be two columns
of signal data. 

In order to perform the signal processing properly, you must use the correct sampling
frequency and time step. You can find both of these by using Sample_Rate_Finder.py

You may need to change some file names in the program. Look for 
the "Export filtered signals" section in AudioEQ.py and make sure you save your outputs to the correct folder.
